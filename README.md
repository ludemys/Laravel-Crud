# Laravel Crud (with some test stuff)
### (With styles made in five minutes)

Really, don't focus on styles, the project was developed without them :)

This crud is made with the help of a [php course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-en-php-sql-poo-mvc-laravel-symfony-4-wordpress/) from Victor Robles [(Here you have his GitHub)](https://github.com/victorobs).

It's a typical CRUD that manages a list of users connected to a database in MySQL (The tables of the database were created through migrations, so you won't find any .sql file).

What I'll make next will be an entire project that emulates a social network, so I'll be learning more!
